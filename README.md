# fcrepo-import-export-verify
Compare two sets of Fedora resources (in live fcrepo or serialized to disk) and verify
their sameness.

This tool is used to test an import or export from/to a [Fedora](http://github.com/fcrepo4/fcrepo4) server.
To learn how to export or import data from/to a Fedora system, please visit
the [Fedora Import Export Utility](http://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/fcrepo-import-export).

## Installation
This tool requires Python. To install it with its dependencies, navigate to the location on
your local system where you wish to install it and do:
```
$ git clone http://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/fcrepo-import-export-verify
$ cd fcrepo-import-export-verify
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: 'pip3' is the required command for the installation of dependencies in a local
Python3 environment (the recommended interpreter); to install dependencies for use
with Python2 instead, simply use the equivalent command with 'pip'.

## Usage
The simplest scenario is to run the script with a single argument pointing to the
location of the import/export configuration file. If, when running the import/export
tool, you did not supply a configuration file, the import/export tool should have
created one in a temporary location that is displayed in the tool's screen output
near the beginning of its run.

This same configuration file is used by the verification tool to set up the verification
process, and is the only required argument. Optional additional arguments for the are
described below.

```
Usage: verify.py [-h] [-u USER] [-c CSV] [-l LOG] [-v] configfile

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -u USER, --user USER  Repository credentials in the form username:password.
  -c CSV, --csv CSV     Path to CSV file (to store summary data).
  -l LOG, --log LOG     Path to log file (to store details of verification run).
  -v, --verbose         Show detailed info for each checked resource on screen.
```
